## Deprecation note

This repository has been deprecated and is currently unmaintained. You can find up-to-date examples for building GraphQL servers with a database [here](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/).

## Features

- **Rapid scaffolding**: Simply use `graphql create` (from the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli)) to download the boilerplate you want.
- **Easily extensible**: A boilerplate only provides the minimum setup so you can tailor the API to your use case.
- **Best practices**: Each boilerplate incorporates best practices from the GraphQL community.
