<div align="center">GraphQL boilerplates provide the perfect foundation for your GraphQL server, no matter if you're just getting started with GraphQL or aim to build a fully-fledged application.</div>

## Features

- **Rapid scaffolding**: Simply use `graphql create` (from the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli)) to download the boilerplate you want.
- **Easily extensible**: A boilerplate only provides the minimum setup so you can tailor the API to your use case.
- **Best practices**: Each boilerplate incorporates best practices from the GraphQL community.
